Let numbers be an array of integers. Get the maximum element in the array that produces the smallest sum when adding all the elements that are different from itself.

Example 1:

Input:

numbers = [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5,6,6]

Output: 6

Explanation:

    For 1, the sum of the rest of elements different from itself is 2+3+3+3+3+4+5+6+6 = 35
    For 2, the sum is 34.
    For 3, the sum is 24.
    For 4, the sum is 32.
    For 5, the sum is 31.
    For 6, the sum is 24.

Both 3 and 6 produce the smallest sum (24), but 6 is greater than 3. Therefore, 6 is the maximum element that produces the smallest sum.

Also, consider that the numbers can be positive or negative.
